Air
Air means Earth's atmosphere. It is the clear gas we live in and breathe in. It has no color or smell. It has weight. Air creates atmosphere pressure. There is no air in the vacuum and cosmos.
Air is a mixture of 78.03% Nitrogen, 20.99% Oxygen, 0.94% Argon, 0.03% Carbon Dioxide, 0.01% Hydrogen, 0.00123% Neon, 0.0004% Helium, 0.00005% Krypton, 0.000006% Xenon.
Humans need the oxygen in the air to live. In the human body, the lungs give oxygen to the blood, and give back carbon dioxide to the air. Plants and animals also need air to live: it is very important to everyone.
The wind is moving air. Air can be polluted from gas, smoke, and ash. Some believe that this pollution may be one of the causes of global warming.
Air is also what planes fly through and what politicians are full of.
There are three things in air, Nitrogen (79%), oxygen (20%), and other types of gases (1%).

Autonomous communities of Spain
Spain is divided in 17 parts called autonomous communities. "Autonomous" means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the United States of America, for example.
Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In 1978 these parts came together, making the autonomous communities.
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called "historic communities": Galicia, País Vasco and Cataluña. These communities have 2 official languages: Spanish and their own language (gallego or eusquera or catalán).
Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: Ceuta and Melilla. They are called "autonomous cities".
